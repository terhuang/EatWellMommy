============
Hello, and welcome to EatWellMommy! We are a blog to help mommies and mommies-to-be be aware 
of what foods may or may not be dangerous to them. For example, we will talk about topics such 
as safe food temperatures, safe food practices, food borne illnesses, viral and parasitic diseases 
that are transmitted from external sources to mommy and baby.

Please feel free to contact us with any questions or comments. We love to hear from you. <3 team EatWellMommy
